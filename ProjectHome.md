**MMS** (Mobicents Multimedia Server) is a Java based Real Time Media server that offers streaming, conferencing, recording, playback, IVR, Text To Speech and other rich media features. It can be accessed programmatically via MGCP or a Media Control (JSR 309) driver that runs in Java EE, SIP Servlets and JSLEE containers.

This project inherits the [Mobicents Media Server](http://www.mobicents.org/mms/mms-main.html) project.

MMS is lead by [TeleStax, Inc.](http://www.telestax.com) and developed collaboratively by a community of individual and enterprise contributors.
